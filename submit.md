## Submission guidelines

We invite applicants to submit posters or short pictorials (see [DIS 2026](https://dis.acm.org/2026/pictorials/) and [IDC 2026](https://idc.acm.org/2026/calls/pictorials/) pages for an explanation and examples of pictorials).

You may submit either:

- **Poster**: a *single-page* large-format poster (A1 size), or  
- **Short pictorial**: a visual extended abstract of up to 4 pages (4x A3 pages, displayed together as an A1-sized poster onsite)


### Required information

All submissions (poster or pictorial) must include the following three elements:

1. **Working definition of (co-)agency**  
   - How are you defining agency/co-agency in your context?

2. **Stakeholder groups considered**  
   - Include the key stakeholders involved in the collaborative activity.  
   - **At least one stakeholder group must be children or young people.**

3. **Role of AI in the work**  
   - Describe what the AI system/application does and how it shapes the interaction, decisions, or collaboration.

The submission form includes fields to describe these elements. They may optionally and additionally be included in the poster or pictorial itself.

In the posters or pictorials, we encourage (where relevant) briefly stating:
- Context of use (e.g., home/school/community)  
- Collaboration structure (who makes decisions, who acts, who supports)  
- What “meaningful” decision-making/action looks like in your setting


### Submission format

Submissions can be in **PDF, PowerPoint, Word, or Adobe InDesign** format.

Please submit a PDF export as the main submission file (max 100MB). You can add original source files as supplementary material (max 250MB; supplementary materials can be added from the author console after you complete the submission). We suggest that you keep reviewers in mind and experiment with lower resolution to make the submission file sizes considerably smaller than maximum limits.

Posters should be 1x A1 size page and pictorials should be up to 4x A3 sized pages. They could be portrait or landscape. References may be included on the back of posters / pictorials and can therefore extend to additional pages.

> Templates are optional (coming soon). You may use your own layout as long as it meets the size/page requirements above.


### Review process

Workshop submissions will be triaged by the organising committee and either desk rejected if they do not meet the submission criteria or peer reviewed following a double-blind peer review process, with at least two reviews for each submission.

There will be only one round of peer review and submissions will be either accepted or rejected.


### Evaluation criteria

Submissions will be reviewed by the workshop organisers and academic peers for relevance, originality, and potential to contribute to the discussion. If we receive a high number of submissions, applicants may be asked to review one or two peer submissions.

Because posters and pictorials are short formats, reviewers will not expect full study details. Please include **just enough information** for reviewers to assess:

- **Relevance** to CAMCAD and the theme of collaborative agency  
- **Originality** of the ideas, methods, findings, or designs  
- **Potential contribution to workshop discussion** (e.g., questions raised, implications, tensions, takeaways)  
- **Clarity** of the submission and strength of its framing/argument  
- **Responsibility and ethics**, especially for work involving children/young people  


### After the reviews

After receiving review feedback, authors of accepted submissions will have a chance to make changes before submitting a final camera-ready version of their poster or pictorial.


## Submission policies

### Anonymisation Policy

We follow the **DIS anonymisation policy** (a relaxed version of the ACM CHI anonymisation policy).

For review, submissions must be anonymised:

- Leave **author names and affiliations blank**
- Leave the **acknowledgements section blank**
- Remove identifying references in the body text where possible (e.g., “our lab at X University”)
- Ensure **no identifying metadata** is embedded in the file (e.g., the ‘Authors’ field in your word processor’s ‘Save As’ dialog box)
- Anonymise **images** that reveal identity (e.g., faces, institutional logos)

You may cite your own prior work, but please do so in the **third person**, e.g.:
- ✅ “As described by Jones et al. [10] …”
- ❌ “As described in our previous work [10] …”

Further suppression of identity in the body of the poster or pictorial is left to the authors’ discretion.

Striving to ensure the fairness of the reviewing process, we will follow a double blind review process, where external reviewers don’t know the identity of authors and authors don’t know the identity of external reviewers. This comes with a couple of caveats, since the workshop organisers' identities are public and since in related venues, like CHI, DIS, and IDC, in previous years some authors have decided to publish their submissions in public archives prior to or during the review process. These public archives have surpassed in reach and publicity what used to happen with tech reports published in institutional repositories. The consequence is that well-informed external reviewers may know, without searching for it, the full identity and institutional affiliation of the authors of a submission they are reviewing. While reviewers should not actively seek information about author identity, complete anonymisation is difficult and can be made more so by publication and promotion of work during the review process. While publication in public archives is becoming standard across many fields, authors should be aware that unconscious biases can affect the nature of reviews when identities are known. We do not discourage non-archival publication of work prior to or during the review process but recognise that complete anonymisation becomes more difficult in that context.


### Policy on Use of Generative AI Models

Text, images, or other media generated from generative AI models, such as ChatGPT, must be clearly marked where such tools are used for purposes beyond editing the author’s own text. Please carefully review the ACM Policy on Authorship (updated September 16, 2025) before you use these tools. The [SIGCHI blog post](https://sigchi.org/news/blog/acm-publications-policy-guidance-for-sigchi-venues/) describes approaches to acknowledging the use of such tools and we refer to it for guidance. While we do not anticipate using tools on a large scale to detect synthetic media, we will investigate submissions brought to our attention and desk-reject submissions where synthetic media use is not clearly marked.


### Copyright and Third-Party Materials

By submitting to CAMCAD, you confirm that you are the **author and copyright holder** of all materials you include, especially photos, illustrations, figures, screenshots, icons. Submitted work must comply with **ACM policies**, which require that you either:
- own the rights to any images and other third-party materials you include, **and/or**
- have obtained **written permission/approval** to reproduce and distribute them.

If you are using **third-party images as a key source** for your poster or pictorial, please include a brief note to reviewers (within the anonymised submission) describing your plan for obtaining the necessary copyright permissions for the camera-ready version.


### Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects

Any research in submissions that involve human subjects must go through the appropriate ethics review requirements that apply to the authors’ research environment. As research environments vary considerably with regard to their requirements, authors are asked to submit a short note to reviewers that provides this context. Please also see the [2021 ACM Publications policy on research involving humans](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects) before submitting.
