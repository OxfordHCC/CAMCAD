description: Child-Centred AI-Mediated Collaborative Agency by Design workshop at CHI 2026
---

Welcome to the draft workshop website. This site is for illustrative purposes only until the workshop proposal is confirmed.

## Call for proposals

The Child-Centred AI-Mediated Collaborative Agency by Design (CAMCAD) at CHI 2026 workshop organisers invite researchers, designers, educators, and practitioners for an afternoon of sharing and exploration of how AI applications could be designed to support children and young people in making informed decisions and enacting them meaningfully.

This workshop builds on previous Child-Centred AI workshops at CHI 2023 and 2024. This year's theme is _collaborative agency_. Through this lens, we are interested in how children and young people can be supported in making and acting on decisions not just as individuals, but in collaboration with others, such as peers, teachers, and parents.

Unlike in previous years, there is no additional cost for attending conference workshops at CHI 2026. We are not anticipating to be able to support remote or hybrid attendance, workshops will run only in-person this year. We are expecting approximately 30 participants to register and attend the workshop.

### Topics of Interest

We welcome submissions that address, but are not limited to, the following themes:
* Models and theories that help understand child-centred co-agency.
* Methods for researching and designing for child-centred co-agency.
* Interaction design case studies that demonstrate novel technologies for collaborative learning, play, or communication.
* Empirical studies of co-agency in AI-mediated interactions.
* Evaluation studies of systems designed to support co-agency.
* Ethical and critical perspectives on designing for intergenerational child-centred collaboration.
* Research tools, policy frameworks, or design principles to support child-centred co-agency.

### Submission Guidelines

Participants are invited to submit full papers (10+ pages), short papers (5-10 pages), or poster abstracts (<5 pages), excluding references. Papers should clearly articulate how the work relates to the workshop theme and explicitly include:
* Working definition of (co-)agency
* Description of the stakeholder groups considered in the research, one of which must be children or young people
* Description of the role of an AI system or application in the research

Submissions will be reviewed by the workshop organisers and academic peers for relevance, originality, and potential to contribute to the discussion.
Applicants will be required to commit to reviewing at least two other submissions for each submitted paper. At least one author will be required to register for and attend the workshop for each accepted submission.

All research conducted with human participants must comply with the [ACM Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects).

### Important Dates
* Submissions Open: Thursday, December 18, 2025
* Submission Deadline: Thursday, February 12, 2026
* Notification of Acceptance: TBC, at least one week prior to conference early bird registration deadline
